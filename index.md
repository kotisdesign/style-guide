# Welcome

These guides are general guidelines to use when working with Kotis Design's
codebase.

It's important to understand that these are "living" documents and are welcome
to be discussed, modified, and refined as we continue to learn and grow.

To propose changes to the guide, start a discussion by opening an issue
on the [kotisdesign/style-guide](https://github.com/kotisdesign/style-guide)
